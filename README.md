# GBGCampDistributor-Extension
Extension version of my Forge of Empires GBG camp distributor

## Usage
[You can install the extension on any Chromium-based browser (such as Chrome, Edge, Opera, almost anything except Firefox) from here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gbg-camp-distributor/ikdffmdnildbkpjpinoiifbfcppfmdpj).  
Using the extension is then as simple as going to the buildings menu of a tile on the GBG map (ensure you reload FOE after installing the extension) or
clicking the camp icon in the FOE Helper menu.  
The UI will show for every tile on the map that your guild owns how many camps it should have for all adjacent tiles not owned by your guild to be
supported by 4 (customizable via settings) camps. The amount is displayed as `required/slot count`. If required and slot count are not the same, it is displayed in green.  
A rewrite of this extension where it'll use the same kind of map FOE Helper's GBG tool uses and will be incorporated into the FOE Helper extension are being worked on,
but I currently do not have much time to work on this. You can follow its progress [here](https://github.com/PlanetTeamSpeakk/foe-helfer-extension/tree/beta).  

**Do note that this extension requires FOE Helper to be installed.**
